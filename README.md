# IPC predict system using NLP

Identification of IPC (Indian Penal Code) system is the system where the system can identify the IPC's on the basis of
structured or un-structured data without human interference. As, the India has largest democracy where polices places important roles in providing justice and punishment,
hence it is essential for them to know the IPC sections which must be imposed on specific charge. Our Indian Constitutional law
is huge and complex, everyone cannot spend their time in reading and understanding it, even law professionals find it complex to
understand it. Therefore, the purpose of our research paper is to present or propose such a system which will be helpful for the
polices to impose the IPC sections on criminals or rule breakers without interference of lawyers as this process can be lengthy and
time consuming. Here, the system uses Universal Sentence Encoder as a model. It predicts the different IPC sections on the basis
of the given input. In this way, it helps to identify the appropriate amendment law (IPC). In this, by using Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and Deep learning(DL) produce accurate results.
